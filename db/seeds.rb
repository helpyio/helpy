This is all contributed for free by a community devoted to building a great customer support helpdesk, and viable alternative to commericial options like Zendesk and Desk.com.

Despite all the gains thus far, we still need YOUR help. If you can do one of the following, please do so to help support the cause. The bigger we can grow the community, the better it will become:

1. Help Spread the Word: If you like what we are doing, please SHARE, TWEET, POST, BLOG and tell all your friends about Helpy. Seriously, this is still a fairly young and little known project. Helping us spread the word is our number one request!

2. Help with I18n: We have had some great translations contributed already. If you translate Helpy to you language and we donâ€™t have it yet, please please please send us a pull request or gist of the yml file.

Thanks in advance for helping us out!',
