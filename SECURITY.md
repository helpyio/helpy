# Reporting security vulnerabilities and exploits

If you discover a security issue in Helpy, please *do not open an issue*.  Instead, you should
either email [hello@helpy.io](mailto: hello@helpy.io) or join us in Slack and contact me (Scott Miller) 
directly.

Please provide detailed information in your email with instructions (screenshots also helpful) of how to
reproduce the issue and any ideas on how best to mitigate will also be helpful!

# Security Hall of Fame

This section is reserved for individuals and organizations who have reported security issues. When
you report a verified security problem, you will have the option of being listed here for all to thank!
